End-to-End Encrypted File Storage System

To check the signup, the backend server must be running.
Go to the Backend folder.
Activate the virtual environment.
Run this in the terminal: "python app.py".
Open signup.html from the Frontend folder in a browser.
Fill the signup form and submit.



Notes:
You'll need to run the backend for the frontend to work, as it manages the database and user authentication. The project is currently a work in progress with just the core functionality implemented.
The backend runs on: http://127.0.0.1:5000
